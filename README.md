Chapter 8 Notes:
For an MVC project don't forget to create the correct structure. Model, View and Controller folders, etc.
Don't forget to register the the repository service in order to connect to a database.
Running the terminal command to use migrations is very important! I missed that step the first time through and would get errors when I run the project. It was very hard to figure out exactly where the problem was since Visual Studio didn't show any errors.
Changing the URL scheme not only makes the URLs look better to the end user, but help us to be more efficient

I still need to get more familiar with Git repositories and syncing to GitHub. I've gotten better over the course of doing both this project and the TopsyTurvyCakes project, but I could still use some more review.
I also need to get a little more familiar with CSS and Bootstrap. I'm following along okay, but its an area that I'm not as strong in.

Chapter 9 Notes:
Use routing to create simple, user friendly URLs
Using repositories makes sorting and such so much easier than typing out long, exact SQL queries. Way cool!
At first I was confused why the "Home" button in the navigation menu didn't light up when the user chose the home option. Home isn't really a category, just a collection of everything. One possible way to improve the project would be to have the home button light up like the other buttons in the navigation.

Chapter 10 Notes:
The banner at the top technically works, but still looks kinda funny.
Despite my many notes reminding me to add migrations and update the database, I still missed that step. Luckily I knew exactly what was wrong as soon as VS said it couldn't find the orders table. Someday I'll remember that before I run the code!
